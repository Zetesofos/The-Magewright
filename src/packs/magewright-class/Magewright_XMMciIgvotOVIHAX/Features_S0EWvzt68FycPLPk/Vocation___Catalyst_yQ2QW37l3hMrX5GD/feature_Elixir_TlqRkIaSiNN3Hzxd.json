      "value": "<p>You are able to distill your magic into elixirs and create a shared group resource called an Elixir Pool available to you and any ally that finishes a respite with you. At the start of an encounter, the Elixir Pool gains a number of elixirs equal to twice your Reason score, which retain their potency until the end of the encounter. </p><p>Once per turn, a creature can consume an elixir as a free maneuver, or use a maneuver to administer an elixir to a willing adjacent creature. They choose one of the following benefits for the elixir to grant when administered: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Surge.</strong> The target gains 2 surges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recovery.</strong> The target can spend a Recovery.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving Throw.</strong> The target can end one effect on them that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of their turn.</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, you can use a maneuver to create an elixir, which can be added to the Elixir Pool, or used immediately by you or an adjacent ally.</p><p></p>",
