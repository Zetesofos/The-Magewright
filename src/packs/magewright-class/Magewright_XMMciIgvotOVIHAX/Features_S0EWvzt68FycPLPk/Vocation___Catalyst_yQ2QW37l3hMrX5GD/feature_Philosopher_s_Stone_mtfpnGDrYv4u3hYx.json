      "value": "<p>When you make a crafting project roll using the Alchemy skill, you gain an edge and you can store the project points in a special alchemical stone. The stone can store a number of project points equal to 50 times your level. As part of this project roll, you can destroy any consumable in your possession and add an equivalent number of project points to the stone.</p><p>As a maneuver, you can expend project points from the stone and craft any consumable that you have both an item prerequisite and project source for, as long as you have the points available. Additionally, you may craft a 1st echelon consumable of your choice without spending any project points. When you use the stone in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a respite.</p><p></p><p></p>",
