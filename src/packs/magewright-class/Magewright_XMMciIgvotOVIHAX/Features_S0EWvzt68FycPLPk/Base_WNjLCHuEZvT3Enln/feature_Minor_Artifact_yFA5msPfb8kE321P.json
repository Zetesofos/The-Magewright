      "value": "<p>After many long nights of planning and experimentation, you have finally finished your masterpiece. You gain any leveled treasure of your choice.  While any hero can wield this treasure, it does not count against the number of treasures that you can carry safely, and you ignore any requirements to wield that treasure, such as a kit. </p><p>Choose a 1st-level enhancement and a 5th-level enhancement of any category. This treasure gains the benefits of those enhancements, even if it does not match the category (armor, implement, or weapon). The treasure does not grant any additional bonus to Stamina or rolled damage that comes from being an imbuement, unless a specific imbuement’s enhancement description notes otherwise. </p><p>You always know the location of your treasure if it is on the same manifold, or which manifold it is on if it is not on the same one as you, and can always summon your treasure to you as a maneuver, if it is on the same manifold. Additionally, if your artifact is ever destroyed, you ignore any project source requirements, and reduce the project goal by half.</p><p></p>",
