      "value": "<p>You are able to upgrade your servitor to better suit your particular needs. Choose one of the following options: </p><p><strong>Steel Defender.</strong> Your servitor always treats a save ends effect as an EoT effect and their characteristic scores increase by 1 for the purpose of resisting potencies. It has an edge on Intuition tests.</p><p><strong>Hunter-Seeker.</strong> Your servitor gains a bonus to its speed and a bonus to the number of squares it can shift when it takes the Disengage move action equal to your Reason score. It gains a +2 bonus to its free strikes and its rolled damage bonus. It has an edge on Agility tests. </p><p><strong>War Frame.</strong> Your servitor replaces its current role with the mount role. Its size and stability increase by 1, with any size 1 target becoming size 2. While mounted on your servitor, abilities that target you have a double bane, and whenever you use your Infusion ability, your servitor can spend a recovery. It has an edge on Might tests.</p><p>When you take a respite activity to change your upgrade you can change the selective function feature for your servitor.</p><p></p>",
